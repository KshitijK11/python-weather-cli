# Python Weather CLI

A command-line application to check the weather of a specified location using Python and the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Description

Python Weather CLI is a simple command-line application built with Python that allows users to check the weather of any location by providing its name or zip code. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and displays it in the terminal. It's a useful tool for quickly getting weather information without the need for a graphical user interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KshitijK11/python-weather-cli.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd python-weather-cli
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests argparse
```

## Usage

To use the Python Weather CLI, run the `weather_app.py` script from the command-line and provide the location for which you want to check the weather.

```bash
python weather_app.py "New York"  # Replace "New York" with the desired location name or zip code
```

The app will fetch weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API and display it in the terminal.

## API Key

To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to obtain a free API key from their website. Follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
2. Once logged in, go to the "API keys" section in your account dashboard.
3. Generate a new API key and copy it.
4. Open the `weather_app.py` file and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key in the `get_weather` function.

Note: Keep your API key private and do not share it in public repositories.
